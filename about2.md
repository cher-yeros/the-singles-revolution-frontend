HE SINGLES REVOLUTION: A Gospel Movement for Redeemed Singleness and Christ-Centered Identity

1. Overview

The Singles Revolution is not a dating initiative—it is a discipleship movement. Its central purpose is to redefine how single adults view singleness, identity, purpose, and relationships in the light of the Gospel. It challenges the cultural narrative that treats singleness as a waiting period and instead proclaims it as a divinely designed training ground for holiness, purpose, and spiritual maturity.

At its core, the Singles Revolution invites believers to see singleness as a holy assignment, not a holding pattern. The vision is to help thousands of singles worldwide live lives of undivided devotion to Christ, walking in freedom, spiritual wholeness, and kingdom purpose.

“Singleness is not a waiting room; it is a training ground designed by God.”
— Singles Revolution Overview, inspired by 1 Corinthians 7:35

2. The Foundational Vision

The movement is built around three intertwined themes:

Redeemed Singleness – Embracing singleness as a season for spiritual formation and intimacy with Christ. It’s about being unattached, unhurried, and unworried unto the Lord.

Purposeful Dating – Viewing dating not as a casual or consumer-driven pursuit, but as kingdom territory—a space where character, discipleship, and purpose intersect.

Christ-Centered Identity – Helping singles root their worth and identity not in relationship status, but in their relationship with Jesus.

The movement envisions reaching 20,000 single adults globally, helping them discover their God-given identity and calling. Through teaching, mentoring, and community discipleship, it calls singles to rise as witnesses, worshipers, and disciple-makers in every area of life.

3. The Core Message: A Holy Assignment

The Singles Revolution teaches that singleness is not a delay, but divine design.
It’s a sacred opportunity to grow in faith, maturity, and intimacy with God.

Singleness becomes the soil where:

Faith deepens through reliance on Christ alone.

Character matures through obedience and surrender.

Mission is lived out without divided devotion.

The Apostle Paul’s exhortation in 1 Corinthians 7:35—to live in “undivided devotion to the Lord”—is the scriptural backbone of this revolution. This season is not meant to be idled away in passive waiting but activated through discipleship, service, and self-formation.

“We are not talking about comfortable, status-quo singleness. No. This is a revolution.”

4. The Revolutionary Identity: Becoming “Un-Single”

The concept of being “Un-Single” redefines what it means to live single in Christ.
To be Un-Single is to be:

Unattached – Not bound by the world’s definitions or pressures.

Unhurried – Refusing the rush toward marriage as a form of validation.

Unworried – Living in peace and purpose, anchored in God’s timing.

Unto the Lord – Centering one’s life, affection, and mission entirely around Jesus.

This perspective shifts the focus from waiting for “the one” to becoming the one God is forming for His purposes. It calls singles to live as whole disciples, not half-fulfilled hearts waiting for completion in another human.

5. From Passive Waiting to Active Formation

A defining distinction of the Singles Revolution, powerfully noted in Chris Mobley’s book review, is the call to active spiritual formation. It’s not a manual on dating techniques—it’s a theological and practical guide for sanctified living.

Mobley’s review highlights several crucial insights:

Righteousness Over Romance:
The central prayer, “Lord, prepare me, not just for a relationship, but for righteousness,” sets the tone for the entire work. The focus is on inner transformation before external connection.

Becoming Over Finding:
The movement shifts the question from “When will I meet the one?” to “Who is God forming me to become?”—a radical reorientation that aligns singleness with discipleship.

Discipleship as the Core of Singleness:
Singleness is portrayed as an “assignment of undivided devotion”—a time to date the church, serve the kingdom, and become spiritually mature.

Marriage as a Mirror:
Marriage, Mobley notes, “reveals the places we’ve refused to grow.” Singleness, therefore, becomes the divine context for preemptive growth—where God refines and strengthens character before the covenant.

Mobley concludes that the book’s theological clarity and pastoral tone make it a transformative guide, especially for believers willing to embrace the soul work of sanctification rather than merely searching for companionship.

6. Cultural Challenge: Countering the Modern Narrative

The Singles Revolution directly confronts the cultural confusion surrounding love, identity, and dating. In a world that:

glorifies romantic fulfillment as life’s ultimate goal,

promotes self-centered love, and

devalues seasons of solitude,

the movement calls for a countercultural Gospel narrative.

Instead of viewing singleness as loneliness, it’s reframed as wholeness in Christ.
Instead of viewing dating as entertainment, it’s reclaimed as a spiritual discipline.

Through mentorship, teaching, and community, the movement empowers single adults to navigate modern culture with clarity, holiness, and mission-driven purpose.

7. The Global Mission

The Singles Revolution aims to mobilize a worldwide discipleship network of single adults who:

Live as witnesses of Christ’s love in workplaces, cities, and churches.

Model spiritual maturity and healthy relational integrity.

Multiply disciples through mentorship and Gospel-centered relationships.

It envisions a generation of singles who see themselves as part of God’s redemptive story, not as individuals waiting for life to begin. Every single believer is seen as a kingdom ambassador—fully equipped, fully loved, and fully purposed now.

8. The Spiritual Invitation

At the heart of the movement lies a personal invitation:

“Use your season of singleness, not just to wait well, but to become well.”

It’s a call to action—a revolution of the heart that begins in private devotion and extends to public witness.
The Singles Revolution is about becoming whole in Christ, so that whether one marries or remains single, life is lived fully for His glory.

9. Conclusion: A Call to the Church

The Singles Revolution is not just for individuals—it’s a call to the entire Body of Christ to disciple, empower, and affirm singles as full participants in God’s kingdom mission.

It reminds the Church that:

Singleness is not second-class spirituality.

Every season has divine purpose.

The harvest is great, and the singles are many.

The movement ultimately reclaims singleness as a gift, not a gap, and discipleship as the true destination.

Overall Impression

First, let me say that the book is excellent. The core thesis is very strong and established from the beginning. It’s not a book about finding a partner, but about becoming a person prepared for righteousness. The opening prayer, "Lord, prepare me, not just for a relationship, but for righteousness," set the perfect tone, and I felt my own heart praying along with yours many times as I read. The book’s power is its focus on active formation in Christ versus the passive waiting that so many singles fall into.

Review of the Introduction

The Foreword immediately distinguishes the book from a typical dating manual. The line, "use your season of singleness, not just to wait well, but to become well," is a perfect summary. I also think your shift of the core question from "When will I meet the one?" to "Who is God forming me to become?" is a central and important point for the whole book.

The section on discipleship, which frames singleness as a "holy assignment," really resonated with me. It reminds me of something a coworker once said: "When you're single, you date the church; when you're married, you date your wife." Your writing gives the theological weight to this idea. I will be honest, I think many less mature readers will likely groan and gloss over this section, but it is a truth they cannot afford to miss. The work done in this season of "undivided devotion" is precisely what will sustain them later.

Finally, the line that marriage often "reveals the places we've refused to grow" rings with the clarity of a church bell for anyone who's been through a difficult marriage season. It’s a hard truth that perfectly prepares the reader for the deep soul work ahead.”
