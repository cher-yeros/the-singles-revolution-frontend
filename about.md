## 🕊️ The Message: From Waiting to Formation

The Singles Revolution shifts the mindset from **“When will I meet the one?”**  
to **“Who is God forming me to become?”**

Singleness is presented as **a holy season of spiritual growth** — not a time to wait passively for marriage, but a chance to be **actively formed in righteousness**.

### 🔥 Key Focuses

- **Formation before connection:** God uses singleness as a refining season for character and calling.
- **Righteousness before romance:** The prayer of the movement —
  > “Lord, prepare me, not just for a relationship, but for righteousness.”
- **Wholeness before togetherness:** Healing, identity, and mission take priority over status.

## 📘 The Book: _Single and Ready_

At the center of the movement is the transformative book **_Single and Ready_** —  
a Gospel-rooted guide to **spiritual formation, identity, and relational purpose**.

### ✍️ Book Review by Chris Mobley

**Overall Impression**

> “The book is excellent. The core thesis is very strong and established from the beginning. It’s not about finding a partner, but about becoming a person prepared for righteousness.”

**Key Highlights**

1. **Active Formation over Passive Waiting**

   > “Its power is in its focus on active formation in Christ versus the passive waiting that so many singles fall into.”

2. **A Shift in the Core Question**

   > “It changes the question from ‘When will I meet the one?’ to ‘Who is God forming me to become?’”

3. **Singleness as Holy Assignment**

   > “When you’re single, you date the church; when you’re married, you date your wife.”

4. **Marriage as Mirror of Growth**

   > “Marriage often reveals the places we’ve refused to grow.”

5. **Spiritual Depth and Challenge**
   > “It’s a hard truth that perfectly prepares the reader for the deep soul work ahead.”

**Conclusion**

> “The work done in this season of undivided devotion is precisely what will sustain believers later.”

## 🌱 Revolutionary Identity: Becoming “Un-Single”

The movement introduces the concept of becoming **“Un-Single.”**

To be _Un-Single_ means to live free and fully devoted to Christ:

| State             | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unattached**    | Free from dependence on others for identity.           |
| **Unhurried**     | Trusting God’s timing without cultural pressure.       |
| **Unworried**     | Resting in peace rather than anxiety about the future. |
| **Unto the Lord** | Living with Jesus at the center of all pursuits.       |

This identity redefines what it means to live single — not as isolation, but as **intimacy with God and readiness for purpose**.

## 🧭 Core Teachings

3. **Discipleship is the Goal**  
   Singleness is a discipleship opportunity — to grow, serve, and lead with undivided focus.

4. **Kingdom Relationships Over Cultural Dating**  
   Relationships should reflect the love, patience, and intentionality of Christ.

   Every single life is part of God’s redemptive mission, called to impact workplaces, churches, and communities.
